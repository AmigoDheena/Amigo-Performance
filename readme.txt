**🎯 Revolutionary Asset Manager (Updated in v3.2)**
The Advanced Asset Manager is now even better with page-wise asset grouping in a convenient accordion interface. This major UI improvement makes it much easier to manage large numbers of assets across your entire website.

**How It Works:**
- Visit any page on your website while logged in as admin
- Click the "Asset Manager" button in the admin bar
- See all CSS/JS files organized by page URL in an accordion interface
- Expand/collapse page sections to focus on specific areas of your site
- Toggle files on/off with simple switches
- Changes apply instantly - test immediately
- If something breaks, restore it with one click

**Key Advantages:**
- **Page-wise Organization:** Assets are grouped by URL for easier management
- **Compact Interface:** Efficiently handle large numbers of resources
- **Site-Wide Control:** Unlike the old system (homepage only), manage assets on every page
- **Visual Interface:** See exactly which files are loading in real-time
- **Safe Testing:** All changes are reversible instantly
- **No Coding Required:** Point, click, optimize - that's it!
- **Professional Results:** Achieve developer-level optimization without technical knowledge

**✨ CSS & JS Minification (NEW Features)**
The new minification features help reduce file sizes by removing unnecessary characters, whitespace, and comments from your CSS and JavaScript files.

**How Minification Works:**
- Enable CSS and/or JS minification in the core settings
- The plugin automatically processes files to reduce their size
- Minified versions are cached for optimal performance
- Original files remain untouched for safety
- File size reductions of 20-40% are common

**Key Benefits:**
- **Smaller File Sizes:** Reduces download time and bandwidth usage
- **Faster Page Loading:** Smaller files load and execute more quickly
- **Improved Performance Scores:** Better PageSpeed and Core Web Vitals metrics
- **No Visual Changes:** Functionality and appearance remain identical
- **Smart Caching:** Minified files are cached for optimal performance

**1. Query String Removal**
Removes version parameters (e.g., `?ver=4.6`) from CSS and JavaScript URLs. Some servers and proxy caches cannot cache files with query strings, even with proper cache headers. This optimization can improve caching efficiency significantly.

**2. WordPress Emoji Removal**
Since WordPress 4.2, emoji support loads additional JavaScript (`wp-emoji-release.min.js`) on every page. If you don't use WordPress emojis, removing this saves 13.5KB and reduces HTTP requests.

**3. JavaScript Defer Parsing**
Defers the parsing of non-critical JavaScript until it's actually needed. This reduces the initial page load time by allowing the browser to render the page content first before processing JavaScript files.

**4. Advanced Iframe Lazy Loading**
Prevents iframes from loading until they're visible in the viewport. Since iframes often load external resources beyond your control, lazy loading can dramatically improve initial page performance.

**5. Modern Image Lazy Loading**
Implements efficient image lazy loading using modern techniques to improve Core Web Vitals, particularly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores.

**6. CSS Minification (NEW in v3.2)**
Reduces CSS file sizes by automatically removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant code. Minified CSS files load faster and consume less bandwidth, improving overall page performance.

**7. JavaScript Minification (NEW in v3.2)**
Optimizes JavaScript files by removing comments, whitespace, and unnecessary characters without changing functionality. Smaller JS files parse and execute faster, leading to improved page speed scores.ques to improve Core Web Vitals, particularly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores.
